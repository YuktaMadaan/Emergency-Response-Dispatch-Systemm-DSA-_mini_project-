# Emergency-Response-Dispatch-Systemm-DSA-_mini_project-
This project simulates an Emergency Response Dispatch System using Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between locations. The system is designed to help dispatch emergency vehicles (such as ambulances, fire trucks, or police) to incidents in the fastest possible way, which can save critical time during emergencies.

The project includes a GUI interface for ease of use, as well as a visual representation of the network paths and the calculated optimal route.

Features
Shortest Path Calculation: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between any two locations on a predefined map.
Real-Time Visualization: Shows the network graph and highlights the shortest path between selected nodes.
Interactive GUI: Built with Tkinter, allowing users to enter start and end locations and view the shortest path and distance.
Error Handling: Provides error messages for invalid inputs or unreachable paths.
